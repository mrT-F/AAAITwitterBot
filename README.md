# AAAITwitterBot
Twitter Bot Created for the AAAI Scavenger Hunt 2015

Suggested Rules:

1. This scavenger hunt will operate through Twitter’s direct message feature. In order to use this, you must follow AAAI’s twitter account, and it must follow you back. Begin by following “@AAAIConference”. The account will respond by following you back prior to the beginning of the conference. If you have a private Twitter account, please accept the follow request prior to the beginning of the conference.

2. Begin your scavenger hunt by sending a direct message to @AAAIConference simply saying “Begin”. You will receive a response with an initial clue, as well as a keyword. The keyword exists to ensure you are following the clues in order, and cannot just send random papers to our Twitter ☺. 

3. When you believe you have found the solution to the aforementioned clue, send a direct message to @AAAIConference with the following text “<previous keyword> <your solution>”. So, for example, if the first keyword you received was “keyword1”, and you believed the solution to the first clue was “Paper 1”, you would send a direct message with the text “keyword1 Paper 1”. 

4. If your solution is incorrect, you will receive a message indicating that. If your response is correct, you will receive a response with the next keyword, and the next clue. Repeat Step 3 until the final message you receive indicates you have finished the Scavenger Hunt!
